## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv(unzip("activity.zip"))
str(activity)
activity_nona <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
str(activity_nona)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(dplyr)

bydate <- group_by(activity_nona, date)
days <- summarise(bydate, total = sum(steps))
mean_steps_by_date <- mean(days$total)
mean_steps_by_date
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
byinterval <- group_by(activity_nona, interval)
intervals <- summarise(byinterval, total = sum(steps))
plot(intervals$total,intervals$interval)
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
byweekday <- group_by(activity_nona, weekdays(as.Date(date)))
weekdays <- summarise(byweekday, total = sum(steps))
plot(weekdays$total,weekdays$interval)
```
```
